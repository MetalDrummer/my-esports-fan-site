      <h5>A bunch of lazy nerds playing video games?</h5>

      <p>Not even close!</p>
      <p>E-sports is shorthand for "Electronic Sports" and is a form of competition that takes place in multiplayer videogames. 
        The amount of time and effort that E-sports athletes put into their craft is staggering and it is my hope that someone 
        who visits this website will be able to see the blood, sweat and teras that has gone into the greatest acheivements of 
        the craft.

      <p>I guess you can call it a passion project!</p>
      <p>I have loved video games ever since I was given my first Playstation at the age of 5. Games are an integral part of my life 
        and through E-sports titles and other video games I am happy to say I have met some of the most important people in my entire life. 
        Games have touched every aspect of my life and it feels nice to give life to that passion in an online space. 
        If even one or two E-sports fans ever see this website and can relate to that feeling I will consider this website a success. 
        Bonus points if I manage to put a few new E-sports fans into the world!

      <h2>About the Website's Author</h2>
      <h5>Who are you?</h5>
      
      <p>My name is Aran and I have been playing competitive video games since my early teens. My favourite games to play are 
        League of Legends and old RTS (Real Time Strategy) games. These are my favourites but Ill play anything really! 
    </p>
        <h5>What E-sports do you love?</h5>
        <p> I have and always will have a soft spot for the League of Legends e-sports scene. I first started watching it way back in 2014
            and fell in love with it. There was  something so visceral and exciting about it. In particular I enjoy watching the European 
            league (LEC) and the Korean league (LCK). I also love watching Starcraft 2 and will soemtimes watch The International and the
            big CS:GO majors when they are on.

        </p>
        <h5> Isn't E-sports just a niche thing for people really into the games?</h5>
        <p>Not at all! E-sports has been rapidly picking up momentum in the last 10 years or so and is now ever starting to compete with 
            traditonal sports for viewership! The below graph even shows League of Legends, perhaps the most popular E-sport at the time 
            of writing closing in on Formula 1! We still have a long way to go before we are competing with the premier league but these 
            prolific e-sports tournaments have gone form being held in the back of conventions to selling out massive stadiums!</p>
